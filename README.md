GEOG777 Project 2 - Mobile App

This proejct was focused on creating a rich user experience while visiting Bryce Canyon National Park. Geodata for the park features was taken from the NPS datastore.

I created this project using react-native, react-native-maps, and react-native-firebase as the three main libraries. 

The app works on Android, but I haven't developed it yet for iOS.
